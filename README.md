# `elm-noodle` üçú

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/elm-noodle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mthadley/elm-noodle)

A *starchy* library for managing application state.

Check out some of the documentation examples in `Noodle` and `Noodle.Tagged`.

If you are following the Elm architecture, organizing code into modules, embeding those modules
into others, you may find that sometimes there is state that you want to persist at
a higher level. You can use this library to help manage both that state, and `Action`s that update
that state.

**Noodle** has taken a lot of inspiration from [`elm-taco`](https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-taco) and
[`redux`](https://redux.js.org/).
