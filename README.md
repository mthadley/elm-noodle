# `elm-noodle` üçú

A *starchy* library for managing application state.

Check out some of the doc examples in `Noddle` and `Noodle.Tagged`.

If you like to organize your models in to seperate modules, and then embed those models
into other modules, you may find that sometimes there is state that you want to persist at
a higher level. You can use this library to help manage that state, and `Action`s that updaate
that state.

**Noodle** has taken a lot of inspiration from [`elm-taco`](https://github.com/ohanhi/elm-taco) and
[`redux`](https://redux.js.org/).
